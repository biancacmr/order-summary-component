## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was the first time I've used a .svg file as background image, and it was something nice to learn about. 

Throughout this challenge I've been studying CSS Flexbox, so I implemented it on the element layout. It's not perfectly responsive, as I'm still learning responsive design, but I am quite happy with the result.
